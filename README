C++ Programming Basics

Topic: Conditional Statements & Coordinate Geometry

This section contains basic C++ programs using if, else if, and else statements to make decisions based on user input. These are part of Experiment 3A, 3B, and 3C for the EnTC-A1 batch.
✅ Experiment 3A: Number Classification

Aim: To write a C++ program that checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Theory: Conditional statements help us decide what action to take based on different conditions.

    if is used when the condition is true.
    else if checks another condition if the first is false.
    else runs when no other condition is true.

In this program, we use these statements to check if the number is greater than, less than, or equal to zero.

Conclusion: The program worked correctly and identified whether the number was positive, negative, or zero. It helped understand how to use simple condition checks in C++.
✅ Experiment 3B: Student Grade Calculator

Aim: To write a C++ program that calculates the average of 5 subject marks and assigns a grade.

Theory: This program uses:

    Arithmetic to calculate the average.

    Conditional statements to assign a grade based on the average:
        O Grade: Outstanding
        A+, A, B+, B, C Grades
        Fail if below pass marks

Grades are decided using if-else if-else statements arranged from highest to lowest range.

Conclusion: The grade calculator worked as expected and assigned the correct grade. This experiment showed how we can combine arithmetic and conditionals for real-world logic like grading systems.
✅ Experiment 3C: Quadrant Identifier

Aim: To write a C++ program that identifies the quadrant of a point (x, y), or checks if it's on an axis or the origin.

Theory: In a 2D plane:

    1st Quadrant: x > 0, y > 0
    2nd Quadrant: x < 0, y > 0
    3rd Quadrant: x < 0, y < 0
    4th Quadrant: x > 0, y < 0
    Origin: x = 0 and y = 0
    On X-axis: y = 0
    On Y-axis: x = 0

The program uses if-else if-else statements with logical operators like && (AND) to check each condition one by one.

Conclusion: The program correctly identified the location of the point. It showed how conditionals and logical operators can solve geometry-based problems in C++.
